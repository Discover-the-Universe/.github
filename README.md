# Discover the Universe GitHub

Discover the Universe is a Canadian bilingual (EN/FR) astronomy education non-profit offered by the Dunlap Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics and the Canadian Astronomical Society in collaboration with the Centre for Research in Astrophysics of Quebec.

Our GitHub is intended to host code that is supporting or a part of our projects, programs, and related interfaces to uphold transparency between our team members, and to be used by educators and students where applicable. Our goal is to follow open software principles where possible.

Each repository may be owned by a different Discover the Universe team member, check out the individual READ ME files to find out more!
